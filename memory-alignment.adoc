== Vector Memory Alignment Constraints

If an element accessed by a vector memory instruction is not naturally
aligned to the size of the element, either the element is transferred
successfully or an address misaligned exception is raised on that
element.

Support for misaligned vector memory accesses is independent of an
implementation's support for misaligned scalar memory accesses.

NOTE: An implementation may have neither, one, or both scalar and
vector memory accesses support some or all misaligned accesses in
hardware.  A separate PMA should be defined to determine if vector
misaligned accesses are supported in the associated address range.

Vector misaligned memory accesses follow the same rules for atomicity
as scalar misaligned memory accesses.
