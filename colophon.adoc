= Preface

This document is a draft of the second release candidate for version
1.0 of the RISC-V vector extension for public review.

*This is not the frozen version of 1.0 for public review*.

NOTE: When finally approved and the release candidate tag is removed,
version 1.0 is intended to be sent out for public review as part of
the RISC-V International ratification process.  Version 1.0 is also
considered stable enough to begin developing toolchains, functional
simulators, and initial implementations, including in upstream
software projects, and is not expected to have major functionality
changes except if serious issues are discovered during ratification.
Once ratified, the spec will be given version 2.0.

This draft spec includes the complete set of currently defined vector
instructions.  Section <<sec-vector-extensions>> lists the standard
vector extensions and which instructions and element widths are
supported by each extension.
